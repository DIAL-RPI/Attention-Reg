# Attention-Reg 

This repository is an implementation of "Cross-modal Attention for MRI and Ultrasound
Volume Registration" accepted by MICCAI 2021. 

To train the model, run "python train_network.py". We have prepared two dummy samples for demo, which can be viewed by running "python view_sample.py". 

Our network is implemented through PyTorch, and the code can be found in "networks/generator.py".
